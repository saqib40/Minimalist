# Minimalist

This project has a tale to tell. It began with me learning Material UI from [Net Ninja's course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gjxLvV4VEkZ6H6H4yWuS58&si=Gr8_EuSif3YJpBRH), but ended up being much more than that.

There's still a long way to go, so contributions are always welcomed.
